Initially created for my final project for Tufts' 2016 Game Design course, Magnetite was my first experience working with both Git and the Unity game engine. Although I have hit numerous setbacks along the way, including a strange physics bug which took me literal months to figure out, I have continued to contribute to the game in my free time, and look forward to implementing much more in the future. 

I apologize in advance for any confusing commit messages, unnecessary content, or un-commented code you come across â€” both the team I was working with at the time and myself were fairly inexperienced when we first started this project. I am working to organize and annotate all of the files in this repository in such a way that outside eyes can understand everything much more clearly.

If you are interested in trying out what has been created thus far, the most recent playable builds can be found in the Builds folder!
